# ðŸ¥˜ Restaurant Ordering System Website

## Project Overview
This is a restaurant website developed as part of my Web Programming course project. The website allows users to place orders, contact the restaurant, and view relevant information about the restaurant. It was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and includes a database that was hosted with the help of Railway.

Features:
- Order System: Allows customers to browse the menu and place orders online.
- Contact Form: Users can reach the restaurant easily for inquiries or feedback.
- Restaurant Info: Displays essential information such as opening hours, location, and more.
